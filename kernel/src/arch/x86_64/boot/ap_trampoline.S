; Before Application Processors are correctly initialized, they are woken up in *real* mode.
; So we must have this assembly code as a workaround to allow APs to have themselves set up (gdt, page tables, 
; etc.) so that they can jump to the kernel.
;
; So, this code snippet comes to aid. As you see, this is called `trampoline`, which means the AP can `jump` to
; protected mode (32bit) and finally come to the kernel space.
;
; This file is assembled by `nasm`. Make sure you have it installed.
