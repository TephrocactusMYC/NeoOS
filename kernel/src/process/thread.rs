//!  An executing program consists of a collection of native OS threads, each with their
//! own stack and local state. Threads can be named, and provide some built-in support for
//! low-level synchronization.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through signals, shared memory, along with
//! other forms of thread synchronization and shared-memory data structures. In particular,
//! types that are guaranteed to be threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container, Arc.
